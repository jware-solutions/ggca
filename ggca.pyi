	:param gem_contains_cpg: Set to True if your GEM data contains CpG Site IDs as the second column to preserve the GEM/CpG Site reference
	:param collect_gem_dataset: True to make the GEM dataset available in memory. This has a HUGE impact in analysis performance. Specify a boolean value to force or use None to allocate in memory automatically when GEM dataset size is small (<= 100MB)
	:param keep_top_n: Specify a number of results to keep or None to return all the resulting combinations
	:return: A tuple with a vec of CorResult, the number of combinations before truncating by 'keep_top_n' parameter and the number of combinations evaluated
